This project is a maintenance error prediction project. In the project, a CSV file containing maintenance data is used as the data source. Data preprocessing steps include checking for missing or outlier values, and removing some columns after the check. Visualization libraries are used to produce meaningful results through visualization. The effectiveness of models and the cleanliness of the code structure are improved using a pipeline structure. The best performing model is saved using the pickle method, and deployment is accomplished using the Streamlit library.
